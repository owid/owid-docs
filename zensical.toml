# Zensical Configuration for OWID Documentation
# This file is ready for when Zensical is fully released

# Features (commented out - enable as needed when Zensical supports them)
# Note: Zensical may have different feature names or implementations
# Refer to Zensical docs when enabling these

# [theme.features]
# Navigation features:
# navigation_tabs = false
# navigation_expand = false
# navigation_sections = false
# navigation_instant = false
# navigation_instant_progress = false
# navigation_prune = false
# navigation_top = false
# navigation_tracking = false

# Content features:
# content_code_copy = false
# content_code_annotate = false
# content_tooltips = false

# Search features (Disco search engine):
# search_share = false
# search_suggest = false
# search_highlight = false

# Table of contents:
# toc_follow = false
# toc_integrate = false

# Markdown extensions
# Note: Zensical will eventually use CommonMark (Rust-based) instead of Python Markdown
# These extensions may need to be adapted when Zensical's module system is released

[markdown]
# Basic markdown extensions
extensions = ["attr_list", "md_in_html"]

# Emoji support
# Note: Zensical handles this differently - check docs when available
# [markdown.emoji]
# emoji_index = "twemoji"
# emoji_generator = "to_svg"

# Repository configuration (currently commented in mkdocs.yml)
# [repository]
# name = "owid/etl"
# url = "https://github.com/owid/"

# Migration notes:
# 1. This config matches your current mkdocs.yml structure
# 2. Zensical can still read mkdocs.yml, so you can use both during transition
# 3. When Zensical stabilizes, test with: uv run zensical serve
# 4. Update navigation structure if you prefer Zensical's auto-discovery
# 5. Check Zensical docs for new module system (expected early 2026)
